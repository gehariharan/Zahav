# Founding Hypothesis

## Template

If we help `customer`  
solve `problem`  
with `approach`  
they will choose it over `competitors`  
because our solution is `differentiation`

## Example: Gmail

If we help `tech enthusiasts`  
solve `overflowing inboxes`  
with `Google data center power`  
they will choose it over `Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo`  
because our solution is `high-capacity & searchable`
