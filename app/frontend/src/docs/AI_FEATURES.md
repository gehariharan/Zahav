# AI-Driven Features in Zahav

Zahav now includes powerful AI-driven features that allow users to interact with the system using natural language. This document explains how to use these features and how they work.

## Overview

The AI Assistant in Zahav enables users to:

1. Create bookings using natural language
2. Set up price alerts using natural language
3. Get instant feedback and confirmation

## Using the AI Assistant

### For Bookings

1. Navigate to the Booking System page
2. Click the "Use AI Assistant" button
3. Type your booking request in natural language
4. The AI will process your request and create a booking

**Example phrases for bookings:**
- "I want to book 100 grams of gold for delivery next week"
- "Book 10 ounces of silver 999 Fine with delivery on 15/12/2023"
- "I need 5 kilos of gold 916 (22K) delivered next month"
- "Book 50 grams of platinum for tomorrow. Notes: Need certificate of authenticity"

### For Price Alerts

1. Navigate to the Rate Alerts page
2. Click the "Use AI Assistant" button
3. Type your alert request in natural language
4. The AI will process your request and create an alert

**Example phrases for alerts:**
- "Alert me when gold goes above 2000 USD"
- "Notify me when silver drops below 30 USD per ounce"
- "Create an alert for platinum when it reaches 1500 USD via SMS"
- "Alert me when palladium exceeds 2500 USD using all notification methods"

## How It Works

The AI Assistant uses natural language processing to extract key information from your requests:

### For Bookings:
- Metal type (gold, silver, platinum, palladium)
- Quantity and unit (grams, ounces, kilos)
- Purity (999 Fine, 995 Fine, 916, etc.)
- Delivery date
- Additional notes

### For Alerts:
- Metal type
- Price condition (above, below)
- Target price and currency
- Notification method

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: Include all relevant details in your request
2. **Use clear language**: Mention the metal, quantity, and other details clearly
3. **Review the confirmation**: Always check the AI's response to ensure it understood your request correctly
4. **Use suggested phrases**: If you're unsure, use one of the suggested phrases as a template

## Switching Between Interfaces

You can always switch between the AI Assistant and the traditional form interface by clicking the toggle button at the top of the page. This gives you flexibility to use whichever method you prefer.
