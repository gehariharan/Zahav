## Advanced Alert Strategies

### Setting Multiple Alerts for the Same Metal

You can create multiple alerts for the same metal at different price points to:
- Track both upward and downward movements
- Create a range of target prices
- Set different notification methods for different thresholds

### Using Alerts for Trading Strategies

- **Breakout Strategy**: Set alerts just above resistance levels or below support levels
- **Trend Confirmation**: Set alerts at key technical indicator levels
- **Risk Management**: Set alerts at your stop-loss or take-profit levels

## Troubleshooting

### Alert Not Triggering

If your alert isn't triggering when expected:

1. Verify the alert is active in your "Active Alerts" list
2. Check that your notification preferences are correct in your profile settings
3. Ensure the price actually reached your target (check price history)
4. Confirm your notification method is working (check email filters, SMS settings, etc.)

### Can't Create or Edit Alerts

If you're having trouble creating or editing alerts:

1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure you're entering valid values (positive numbers, etc.)
4. Contact support if the issue persists
